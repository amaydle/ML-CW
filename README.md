# ML-CW

This project serves as the coursework for the machine learning module. It encompasses two distinct tasks, both accomplished individually using R as the primary programming language.

The first task involves the utilization of the k-means clustering algorithm to establish meaningful clusters within a designated dataset. The clusters are subsequently evaluated to assess their effectiveness.

The second task focuses on predicting the electricity usage of a university building, leveraging historical data. This prediction is achieved through the implementation of a deep neural network, offering a comprehensive understanding of the building's energy consumption patterns.
